A http://dsury.com[blog and project showcase platform], following my pursuit of actuarial credentials and experience.

== What kind of projects will be featured here?
I'll be highlighting projects and programming experiences relevant to an actuary or data analyst. These will be projects involving relevant and applicable stoichiometric processes and analyses.

== Why are you blogging?
Many reasons, but mostly for personal enrichment. 
Most blog posts will be personal recollections of events. Many of the best ideas are inspired by life experiences, so I intend to blend projects with blogs/articles.

== Special thanks to:
The Hubpress team for building this wonderful engine to run a blog.
