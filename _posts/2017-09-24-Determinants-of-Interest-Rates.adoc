=== Federal funds rate

Interest rate for one bank to borrow from another bank's reserve (to meet minimum reserve requirements). Adjusted to approximately match "federal funds target rate."

=== Discount rate

Rate that banks can borrow at, *directly* from federal reserve bank.

=== LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate)

International interest rates for short-tern loans.

=== Federal Reserve Bank (US's central banks)

1. Board of Governors
2. 12 regional reserve banks
3. FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) sets federal funds target rate to stabilize: employment rate, stable prices, moderate long-term interest rates

=== Bond Concepts

* *call provision:* option for issuer to pay (above par) before maturity date
* *put provision:* option for holder to sell (below par) to issuer before maturity.

These give option to re-negotiate a new bond at better interest rate, following liquidity preference theory and opportunity cost theory.

* *revenue bonds:* example - contingent on tolls for drivers on bridge, charges to homeowners for water services, etc
* *general obligation bonds:* backed by general taxing authority or state/local government

=== Interest Concepts

* *yield* with risk of default should be _higher_ to compensate for this risk
* *"prime rate"* - rate charged to bank's best and most creditworthy customers. only a few entities receive this rate, but it is used as a benchmark for comparison.

=== Treasury Bills (T-Bills):

* 1 year or less term
* no interest
* sold at discount
* quoted with simple discount & actual/360

=== Treasury Notes/Bonds (T-Bond):

* 2~30 years term
* semi-annual interest coupons
* sold at or near par
* quoted with semi-annual compounding
